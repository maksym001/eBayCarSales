This is project to explore ebay data and find the main contributing factor in the car price.  Is it car mileage or car brand?

In this project the following would need to be done:

* Clean Data (e.g. many numerical fields stored as strings, columns convert from Camel to Snake case etc)
* Analyze car listings
* Provide conclusion
